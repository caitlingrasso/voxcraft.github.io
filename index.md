In voxcraft everything starts with a **voxel**: a hollow silicone block that can expand and contract in volume. 
When multiple voxels are attached together they become a robot: a **voxelbot**. 
<br><br>

![image](img/Behavior.png)
The **behavior** of a voxelbot depends on the arrangement of its voxels (its body shape) and how they expand/contract, which is controlled by a hand pump or a motor.

_There are endless designs waiting to be discovered!_


### **Ready to start?**
All the materials you need to build your own voxelbots are linked in our [kit](/kit).


### **Not sure what to build?**
You can try out some designs in simulation before deciding which one you want to make. 
We provide a [gui](/design#viz), 
a gpu-accelerated [simulator](/design#sim),
and a machine learning package for [auto design](/design#evo).

### **Have the kit and a design in mind?**
It’s time to [build](/build) it!


### **Did you make something cool?**
[Send us](/team) pictures/videos of your voxelcraft creatures and we’ll add them to our [zoo](/zoo).


### **Are you stuck?**
Check out our [FAQ](/faq). If you can’t find the answer to your question there, please [email us](/team).


### **Did you discover something new?**
The AI and robotics communities are hungry for better/faster/cheaper ways to design and manufacture soft robots. 
Publish a [research](/research) paper detailing your innovation!
Great venues include conferences such as
